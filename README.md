# NARS: Not A Replication of Sutton

This project is not a mere Python *replication* of the experiments in Sutton & Barto's book [*Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) (referred as the Book in the following), on which [Zhang Shangtong](https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/reinforcement-learning-an-introduction) has done a wonderful job.

Instead, it verifies important concepts in the Book in an *independent* and *rigorous* way and presents them in an *interactive* and *animated* way.

Not only does it help you better understand the Book, but also it corrects some errors neglected by Sutton and Barto.
